# FaceMaskDetection

With the help of OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifier, implemented mask detection. The outputs were accurate upto a certain extent. In low lighting, the model showed certain inaccuracy. There were also false positives as well, as shown in the output section. This proposed architecture can be implemented in malls and other densely populated places and can be connected to an alarm that can notify owners or other administrators that there are users without masks and can hence ensure safety and 
well-being of other people in the surrounding area.
